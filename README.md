## What is a Privacy Policy

A privacy policy is a description of what you do with personal data.  The critical things to describe in the policy are how you and your website or app collect, use, store, and share or disclose information about people. Providing a privacy policy also helps your users understand what happens to information about them.

**Note:** A Privacy Policy is not the same as the Terms and Conditions agreement. A Terms and Conditions is the agreement where you include the rules and guidelines that users must agree to in order to use your website or app.


## What is a Personal Data
